Office 2010 Style Ribbon Toolbar in HTML/CSS/JS
===============================================

I have created an implementation of the Office 2010 Ribbon toolbar that can be used in any website. It is written in HTML, CSS, and JS. Try a demo at http://okgodoit.com/ribbon/ or watch the video at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YOpn2W-fQ8.

Some highlights
---------------

  - Default (silver and blue) and alternate (silver and red) themes
  - .less styling so you can make your own themes easily
  - 2010-style Backstage feature (optional)
  - 2 button sizes
  - Buttons can have a disabled state
  - Tabs, sections, and buttons can all have custom HTML (such as bold or entities) in their titles
  - Optional hot and disabled icon states
  - Full HTML in ScreenTip (tooltip) supported
  - So far I’ve tested it in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and IE 8+.
  - Uses the jQuery framework.

  
There’s still a lot of work left to be done, but I wanted to get it on here.


Please note that you legally should license the ribbon UX from Microsoft (for free) at http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/aa973809.
