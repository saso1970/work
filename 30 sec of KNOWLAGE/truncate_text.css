.truncate-text{
    overflow: hidden;
    white-space: nowrap;
    text-overflow: ellipsis;
    width: 200px;
}

/*
Explanation
overflow: hidden prevents the text from overflowing its dimensions (for a block, 100% width and auto height).
white-space: nowrap prevents the text from exceeding one line in height.
text-overflow: ellipsis makes it so that if the text exceeds its dimensions, it will end with an ellipsis.
width: 200px; ensures the element has a dimension, to know when to get ellipsis
